    "X = \"I've had Cox internet/cable service at my home in Tempe since 2008. So far I feel like we're subsidizing a predatory monopoly by allowing Cox to stay in business preventing fair competition in the market.\\n\\nFor example:\\n(a) Installation didn't work. They will only set up one jack for internet and will only use existing lines. So if you have cable jacks that are not hooked up to your current line, they are essentially useless. Cox won't activate a jack that is for example, in your living room, if it isn't already activated. \\n\\n(b) Service has interruptions and is not as fast as advertised. Because all the cable lines in Tempe are above ground, anytime a tree hits the power poles, you don't have internet for a few days.\\n\\n(c) Cable lines above ground also conduct lightning. When lightning hit near my neighbors house across the street nothing except my roommates computer was fried because I have every outlet on a surge protector. Where the ethernet cord was connected to my roommates computer, there was a visible burn and his laptop was destroyed.\\n\\n(d) Billing is not rational. If you decide to change the amount of service you subscribe to, they overbill you. You will spend several hours on the phone with customer service for your next three bills, because what they didn't overcharge you for the first months, they will overcharge you for in the following 3 months.\\n\\n(e) When there are billing problems they will turn off your account for a $14 difference even if it is not a month overdue  without giving you notice. Then they charge you a fee for the turn off. Then when you call to have it fixed, they tell you to call back when the billing department opens weekdays bankers hours.\\n\\n(f) Then they stop sending you a bill. I haven't received a bill for over 9 months. I just autopay from my checking account and have no idea what they are doing with my money. I've asked them to send it to me, but people on the phone never seem to be able to follow through.\\n\\n(g) To top it all off, I just received a threat of suit because Lions Gate alleges that I downloaded a movie, that I didn't download. Cox cable gave them my ID from my IP address so they could look at the transactions that occur from my IP address. When I responded that the download was false, I get an automatic reply telling me to encrypt my wireless and am directed to call their useless customer service line. -I never signed away my rights to privacy, and I don't download movies (have netflix, no need).\\n\\n(h) The local free TV stations can't be seen unless we buy the basic cable package. \\n\\nThe threat of suit  based on my alleged internet use is the last straw. Cox is a predatory business that uses it's monopoly on pre-existing cable lines to assert it's authority over our access to information on the internet, and what should be free television stations.  Cox cable didn't provide the infrastructure they are using; they shouldn't be allowed to benefit from the tax breaks we gave the phone and electricity companies to set up the network of  lines Cox now uses. They shouldn't be given this benefit, because they overcharge for their services, have predatory billing practices and fail to respect our individual privacy in our homes.\"\n",

Roeper took this show down a notch or two because he wasn't really a film critic and because he substituted snide for opinionated. Now, when Ben Lyons comes on I feel like I'm watching 'Teen News' -- you know, that kids' news show, hosted by kids for kids? Manckiewitz is not much better. It's obvious they've encountered only a steady diet of mainstream films their entire lives. The idea that these two rank amateurs have anything of interest or consequence to say about motion pictures is ludicrous. If they are reviewing a non-formula film, they are completely lost. Show them something original and intelligent -- they just find it 'confusing'. Wait -- I think I get it ... ABC is owned by Disney ... Disney makes movies for kids. While Siskel, Ebert, and Roper promoted independent films and were only hit-or-miss with the big budget studio productions -- what a surprise: these two guys LOVE the big studio schlock and only manage to tolerate a few indies. Plus everyone knows the age group TV advertisers are aiming for. The blatant nepotism is the icing on the cake. In what alternate universe do these guys qualify as film critics?\"\n",
